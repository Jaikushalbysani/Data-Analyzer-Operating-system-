# Data-Analyzer-Operating-system-
This project is done using python language

The objective of this Python code is to create an application that monitors a specific process's CPU and memory usage, issuing warnings if system-wide thresholds are exceeded. This application utilizes the Tkinter library to create a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) and runs two separate threads for real-time monitoring of both the targeted process and the system's resource usage. The user can start and stop the analysis as needed, and the main event loop ensures that the GUI remains responsive during the monitoring process.


The code is designed to detect if the CPU and memory usage of the monitored process or the system as a whole exceeds predefined thresholds. When these thresholds are crossed, the application will issue warnings. These warnings could be in the form of notifications, pop-up messages, or any other user-defined alerts.


The main event loop of the application is designed to ensure that the GUI remains responsive during the monitoring process. This means that the user can continue to interact with the application and make changes while the monitoring threads are running.
Overall, the objective of this code is to create a user-friendly monitoring application that helps users keep track of a specific process's resource usage and the overall system's resource utilization. It provides a real-time view of these metrics and alerts the user when predefined thresholds are exceeded. This could be useful for system administrators, developers, or anyone who needs to ensure that a specific process doesn't consume too many resources or to monitor system health.
